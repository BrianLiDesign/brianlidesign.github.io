## Project Description

A clean and minimalist hub showcasing the work and ethos of a Computer Engineering student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. With a focus on the tagline "Code with Precision. Circuits with Purpose," my website highlights my technical projects, writing, and professional background in an elegant, user-friendly format

/.github: This directory contains GitHub-specific configuration files. In this case, it includes `dependabot.yml`, which automates dependency updates for my project.

/assets: This directory contains static resources that support the website. It is subdivided into:

- /data: Stores data files, such as resumes or documents used on the site.
- /fonts: Contains custom font files for consistent typography across the website.
- /images: Contains image assets used throughout the site. Within it, /icons holds smaller icon graphics.

/css: This directory contains stylesheets (CSS files) that define how the website looks, including layout, colors, and typography.

/js: This directory contains JavaScript files that add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the site, such as scrolling effects and event handling.

/pages: This directory contains the main HTML pages of the website, such as `index.html`, `projects.html`, and `about.html`. These are the actual pages visitors will navigate to.

README.md: A text file containing reference information about the project, such as setup instructions, usage details, or notes for developers.
